**Hi, I'm Joe Tenis** (*aka Jazeps*).

As often as I'm able, I'm a game developer, artist and writer, who also happens to be an open-souce enthusiast. Right now I'm collaborating with my wife on two games (one long-term and one short-ish-term), and am also focused on developing and contributing to apps for Linux, primarily using GNOME/GTK.

As far as learning, my focus at the moment is going deeper with Python while also getting more familiar with the common tools, technologies and workflows associated with that. I'm hoping to level up by collaborating on open-source projects with more experienced developers while seeking a position with a company where I can contribute to a team and help solve problems.
